# Python DSA for Practical Problem Solving (ML-Oriented)

This repository documents my structured practice of **Python fundamentals and practical Data Structures & Algorithms**, with a strong focus on **real-world problem solving** and **Machine Learning readiness**.

The goal is not competitive programming, but to build:
- Clear algorithmic thinking
- Strong Python foundations
- Efficient data handling skills
- A smooth transition into Machine Learning and Deep Learning workflows

## How This Repository Is Structured

Each topic is organized by **concept and problem-solving pattern**, not by difficulty.


---

## Problem-Solving Approach

Every problem in this repository follows a consistent structure:

1. Problem understanding
2. Real-world analogy
3. Brute-force approach
4. Optimization strategy
5. Clean Python implementation
6. Time and space complexity analysis

This mirrors how problems are approached in **engineering systems** and **ML data pipelines**, not just interviews.

## Why This Matters for Machine Learning

Data Structures and Algorithms are foundational for:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Efficient data traversal
- Memory and performance optimization

This repository acts as a **bridge between Python basics and Machine Learning development**.

---

## Status

This repository is actively maintained and expanded as part of a disciplined learning plan.
